This project is currently in progress.

The goal of this project is to predict the outcomes of NFL games before they happen based on years of historical statistics and trends in outcomes. Variables in the regression include win percentage, current streak, pass/rush yards gained/allowed, average scores, vegas spreads, and more in an effort to train a few different models on various outcomes.

The two models I want to build are a logistic regression model that takes in this data and outputs a binary 'will the home team win this game' outcome. The base of this model is complete it just requires minor tweaking and inspection. The other model will be a linear regression model that takes in this data and outputs a score for eac team. This will be a rough estimate of scores to compare on spreads as well as another indicator of who will win the game. These models will be contrasted with each other to find the best way to predict game outcomes before they even have to be played.
